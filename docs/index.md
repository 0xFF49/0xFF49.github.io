# About me.
Hello! I'm .__newindex. I'm a 19 year old college student who's taking Game Development as a major. I've been on the Roblox platform since 2017. I've managed to make a lot of memories on this platform and have had the opporunity to play many awesome games. In 2018, I started to dabble in the development side of Roblox and fell in love with programming different thing in Roblox Studio using Lua. It's now 2025 and my interests have grown from making Roblox games to launching my own game studio some time in the future.

My other interests include drawing, the gym, sports, anime and gaming. I espeically like playing Minecraft, Fortnite and many Nintendo games.

# My Developer Skills.
I specialize in scripting. I have a great grasp over concepts such as CFrame math, OOP, ECS, parallel scripting, the Luau type system, efficient networking, data compression and efficient data saving/loading. I am also capable of using Github for version control, Rojo for file syncing and Wally as a package manager.

## What does this mean for you?
Because of these powerful concepts, I can make a wide variety of systems that may be asked of me, such as
* Pet Systems
* Combat Systems
* Trading Systems
* FPS Systems
* Round-based Systems
* Custom Camera Systems
* Building/Plot Systems
* Vehicle Systems

And many more. Just ask me.
